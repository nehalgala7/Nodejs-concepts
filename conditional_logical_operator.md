# Condtional and Logical operators

## Overview
 
Conditional and logical operators are used in decision-making statements, which determine the path of execution based on the condition specified as a combination of multiple Boolean expressions. 

A critical requirement of every conditional is the condition. The condition is what determines the decision to be made in the program.

In JavaScript, this condition can be any valid expression. Usually, this condition expression, however complex it is, is evaluated to one of two values called booleans: either true or false.

A proper understanding of how the JavaScript engine converts these condition expressions to booleans is necessary for writing correct and predictable conditional logic.

Identifying truthy and falsy values fundamental concept that can enable us to understand the conversions - 
Every value in JavaScript can be classified as either truthy or falsy. The falsy values in JavaScript are as follows:

```
'' or "" or ``(an empty string)
0 or -0 (the number 0)
null
undefined
NaN
false
```
Every other value besides the ones in this list are truthy values. Whenever JavaScript expects a boolean value, truthy values are implicitly coerced to true while falsy values are implicitly coerced to false.

## Introduction

### Conditional Operators

Sometimes, we need to perform different actions based on different conditions. For this we use condtional operators. There are different types of conditionals operators in javascript. Click on each on of them to read in depth about it.

2. [if - else](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/else-statement-javascript/#if-else)  conditional operator 
3. [if - else if - else](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/else-statement-javascript/#if-else-if)  conditional operator
