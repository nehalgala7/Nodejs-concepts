# Variables, Data types, Type conversions

## Overview
 
In this Concept, we will help you understand about the basic building blocks of JavaScript i.e variables.

You'll be writing a program to find the largest and the smallest number from a list once we have covered all the topics under the section - Basic Javascript.

For now, after this concept you'd be able to declare a variable and initialize it with one of the basic data type.


## Learning Outcome

- What is a variable?
- How to create a variable, store/modify value in a varaiable, and use it in the program?
- What is a data type and what are the basic data types supported in Javascript?
- How type conversions work in javascript


## Introduction

### Variables in JS

The variable is one of the most fundamental concepts in any programming language. It is the basic unit of storage in a program. A variable is a way to store information so that you can later use it.

JavaScript variables were solely declared using the var keyword followed by the name of the variable and semi-colon. Below is the syntax to create variables in JavaScript:

```
var var_name;
var x;
```

The var_name is the name of the variable which should be defined by the user and should be unique. There are rules one must adhere to while defining a varaible.

### Data types 



#### what must you do

- Read more about how to [create and initialize variables in javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp)
- Read about [different data types in javascript](https://javascript.info/types) and also solve the excerises given there. Deep dive into [Types & Data Structures Basics](https://codeburst.io/javascript-essentials-types-data-structures-3ac039f9877b).
- In this post, we will learn JavaScriptâ€™s variable scope and hoisting and all the idiosyncrasies of both.We must understand how variable scope and variable hoisting work in JavaScript, if want to understand JavaScript well. These concepts may seem straightforward; they are not. Some important subtleties exist that we must understand, if we want to thrive and excel as JavaScript developers.
