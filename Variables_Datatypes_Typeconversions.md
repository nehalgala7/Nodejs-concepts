# Variables, Data types, Type conversions

## Overview
 
In this Concept, we will help you understand about the basic building blocks of JavaScript i.e variables.

You'll be writing a program to find the largest and the smallest number from a list once we have covered all the topics under the section - Basic Javascript.

For now, after this concept you'd be able to declare a variable and initialize it with one of the basic data type.


## Learning Outcome

- What is a variable?
- How to create a variable, store/modify value in a varaiable, and use it in the program?
- What is a data type and what are the basic data types supported in Javascript?
- How type conversions work in javascript


## Introduction

*Variables*

The variable is one of the most fundamental concepts in any programming language. It is the basic unit of storage in a program. A variable is a way to store information so that you can later use it.]

JavaScript variables were solely declared using the var keyword followed by the name of the variable and semi-colon. Below is the syntax to create variables in JavaScript:

```
var var_name;
var x;
```

The var_name is the name of the variable which should be defined by the user and should be unique. There are rules one must adhere to while defining a varaible. You can read more about it here

*Component Lifecycle*

Each component in React has a lifecycle which we can monitor and manipulate during its different phases.

The  phases are:  Initialization, Mounting, Updating and Unmounting

Intitalisation: Defining defaults and initial values for states

Mounting: Putting elements into the DOM

Updating: Modify component's states

Unmounting: Removing elements from the DOM


## What must you do?


-	Familiarise yourself with [what State is in ReactJS](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_state.asp)

-	Next, Read and understand [how they have changed the component created earlier into a class-based component to accommodate state](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html). Read the section up to ‘Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class’.

-	After that, take a [look at graphical description of the component life-cycle and understand when each of the life-cycle methods are called](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs-lifecycle-components/)

-	Once you complete reading the above article, check out the [list of lifecycle methods](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html) there are in React. Pay close attention to the lifecycle methods which are now considered unsafe. 


-	Finally, go back to the second link [page](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html) and continue reading from the ‘Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class’ till the end. 
Make an important note of the Using State Correctly section.



## Additional Resources

- If you still feel confused by the lifecycle methods, read and and get a thorough understanding of [every lifecycle method in detail with an example](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_lifecycle.asp)

- Read the section titled **Common React Lifecycle Methods** in [this article](https://programmingwithmosh.com/javascript/react-lifecycle-methods/) to understand the lifecycle methods that are more commonly used over others.
