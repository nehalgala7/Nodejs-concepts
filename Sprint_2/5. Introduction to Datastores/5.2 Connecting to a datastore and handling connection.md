### Overview
In the previous chapter you learnt about how what a database.
In this section we will learn how to install database drivers and use them in our application. Also, we will dive deep into, how to access relational database postgresSql in our node application using Express.

### Learning Outcome
- How to access any database in Node?
- How to access and connect to PostgresSql in Node?

### Introduction
Node.js supports all kinds of databases whether its a relational database or NoSQL database. However, NoSQL databases like MongoDb are the best fit with Node.js.

- To access the database from Node.js, you first need to install drivers for the database you want to use.

| Relational Databases | Driver | NPM Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MS SQL Server	| [mssql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mssql) | npm install mssql |
| Oracle	| [oracledb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oracledb)	| npm install oracledb |
| MySQL	| [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)	| npm install mysql |
| PostgreSQL | [pg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) | npm install pg |
| SQLite | [node-sqlite3](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3)	| npm install node-sqlite |

This is not the complete list of database and drivers available. Also, there are many drivers available for each database. You can choose a driver based on your requirement.

Since we are going to use postgresSql. Let us begin by installing drive for the same using the command.
```
     npm install pg
```

- In order to use the database in your application we need to connect to the data and maintain the connection throughout the lifecycle.

2. Connecting to PostgresSql
- To connect to a database you need client object. The client needs following config properties: 
    - host: The host that the database is operating on should have been provided by your hosting provider.  Typically this would be configured as localhost, assuming your web server and database server are on the same host. It will be "localhost" in our case.
    - port: The port on which it is running
    - user: The user name of the database
    - database: Name of the database to connect to
    - password of teh database

- Add the snippet below to connect to a database. 
```
const client = new Client({
  user: 'dbuser',
  host: 'database.server.com',
  database: 'mydb',
  password: 'secretpassword',
});
```
Note: These are example values. Use the values you have added while configuring the database.

Once we create the instance of the client we need to use client.connect to connect to the database. 

```
client.connect()
    .then(() > {
        console.log("connected successfully"); // this is executed if the connection is succesfull
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.log("error connecting to database", error); // this block is executed when there is some error connecting to the database.
    });
```
client.connect() return a promise. so we can execute the then once the promise is resolved.
