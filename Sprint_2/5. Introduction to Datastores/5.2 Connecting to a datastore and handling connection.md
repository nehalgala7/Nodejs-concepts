### Overview
In the previous chapter you learnt about how what a database.
In this section we will learn how to install database drivers and use them in our application. Also, we will dive deep into, how to access relational database postgresSql in our node application using Express.

### Learning Outcome
- How to access any database in Node?
- How to access and connect to PostgresSql in Node?

### Introduction
Node.js supports all kinds of databases whether its a relational database or NoSQL database. However, NoSQL databases like MongoDb are the best fit with Node.js.

- To access the database from Node.js, you first need to install drivers for the database you want to use.

| Relational Databases | Driver | NPM Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MS SQL Server	| [mssql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mssql) | npm install mssql |
| Oracle	| [oracledb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oracledb)	| npm install oracledb |
| MySQL	| [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)	| npm install mysql |
| PostgreSQL | [pg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) | npm install pg |
| SQLite | [node-sqlite3](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3)	| npm install node-sqlite |

This is not the complete list of database and drivers available. Also, there are many drivers available for each database. You can choose a driver based on your requirement.

Since we are going to use postgresSql. Let us begin by installing drive for the same using the command.
```
     npm install pg
```

- In order to use the database in your application we need to connect to the data and maintain the connection throughout the lifecycle.
