### Overview
Now that we know how to import core modules and third part modules, let us go head and see how to create our own modules and export it.

### Learning Outcome
- How to create a module?
- How to export the created module so that we can use it in our application?
- What is module object?
- What’s the Difference Between module.exports and exports?

### Creating and exporting a Module
Now let's look at how to create our module and export it. So that we can use it elsewhere in our application.
Let us do it by creating a calculator Node module and then use the calculator module in another file. 

Create calculator.js and add the code below:
```
    // Returns sum of two numbers
    const add = function (a, b) {
        return a+b;
    }; 
```

Now create an index.js file in the same folder and add this:
```
    let calculator = require('./calculator'); //import the module
    
    const a=10, b=5;
    
    console.log("Sum : " + calculator.add(a, b));
```

Note: You import a module you created in same way like we imported a core or a third party module

Run the program using node index.js and you should see the following output to the terminal:
```
    Sum : 15
```

So what has happened here ? If you look at the calculaor.js file, you’ll notice that we’re defining a add function, then using the exports keyword to make it available for import elsewhere. Then in the index.js file, we’re importing this function and executing it. Also notice that in the require statement, the module name is prefixed with ./, as it’s a local file. Also note that there’s no need to add the file extension.


### Exporting multiple methods and values 
calcular.js
```
    // Returns sum of two numbers
    const add = function (a, b) {
        return a+b;
    }; 
    // Returns difference of two numbers
    const subtract = function (a, b) {
        return a-b;
    }; 
    
    // Returns product of two numbers
    const multiply = function (a, b) {
        return a*b;
    }; 

    exports.add = add;
    exports.subtract = subtract;
    exports.multiply = multiply;
```

index.js
```
    let calculator = require('./calculator'); // you can give any name to the variable not necessary to name it calculator and it will work fine
    
    const a=10, b=5;
    
    console.log("Sum : " + calculator.add(a, b));
    console.log("Difference : " + calculator.subtract(a, b));
    console.log("Product : " + calculator.multiply(a, b));
```

Run the program using node index.js and you should see the following output to the terminal:
```
    Sum : 15
    Difference : 5
    Product : 50
```

You can also export values and methods as you go, not just at the end of the file
Example: calculator.js
```
    // Returns sum of two numbers
    exports.add = function (a, b) {
        return a+b;
    }; 
    // Returns difference of two numbers
    exports.subtract = function (a, b) {
        return a-b;
    }; 
    
    // Returns product of two numbers
    exports.multiply = function (a, b) {
        return a*b;
    }; 
```

and then import in export js in the same way.
