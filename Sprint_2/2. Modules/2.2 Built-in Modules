### Overview

In previous chapter we saw what are modules and what are its types. In this chapter we will dive deep into of the types i.e core modules or built-in modules in Node. 


### Learning Outcome
- What are core or built-in modules in node?
- How to use them in our application?


### Introduction
-   Node.js has a set of built-in modules which you can use without any further installation.
-   The core modules include bare minimum functionalities of Node.js. These core modules are compiled into its binary distribution and load automatically when Node.js process starts. However, you need to import the core module first in order to use it in your application.
-   They are referred by the module name, not the path.

### List of important core modules in Node.js
- [fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html): Allows you to manipulate (create/read/write) files and directories.
- [path](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html): utilities to work with files and directories paths.
- [http](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html): create HTTP servers and clients for web development.
- [url](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html): utilities for parsing URLs and extracting elements from it.
