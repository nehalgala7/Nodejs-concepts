### Overview
Within computer programming, the acronym CRUD stands for create, read, update and delete. These are the four basic functions of persistent storage. Also, each letter in the acronym can refer to all functions executed in relational database applications and mapped to a standard HTTP method, SQL statement or DDS operation.
Let us read more about it in this chapter.

### Learning Outcome
- What is CRUD?
- CRUD in database.
- CRUD paradigm in constructing web applications, i.e How can it be mapped to HTTP verbs(GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)?

### Introduction
#### CRUD
- In computer science, the acronym CRUD stands for create, read, update and delete. These are the four basic functions of persistent storage. 
- Also, each letter in the acronym can refer to all functions executed in relational database applications and mapped to a standard HTTP method, SQL statement or DDS operation.
- It can also describe user-interface conventions that allow viewing, searching and modifying information through computer-based forms and reports. In essence, entities are read, created, updated and deleted.

#### CRUD in database
The main idea of relational databases is that data is stored in tables. In addition, this table data can be read, inserted, deleted or edited by the CRUD operations. So CRUD operation is basically used to manipulate table data.
    - CREATE – insert row/rows to table.
    - READ – read (select) row/rows from a table.
    - UPDATE – edit row/rows in the table.
    - DELETE – delete row/rows in the table.

#### CRUD paradigm in constructing web applications
- When we are building APIs, we want our models to provide four basic types of functionality. The model must be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete resources/data. 

- The CRUD paradigm is common in constructing web applications, because it provides a memorable framework for reminding developers of how to construct full, usable models.

- In a REST environment, CRUD often corresponds to the HTTP methods POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE, respectively.
