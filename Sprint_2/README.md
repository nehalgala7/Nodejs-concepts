## Sprint 2 - Getting started with Advanced Javascript, Modules, APIs and Datastores

### Overview

Gets you started with advanced JS constructs and introduces you to ECMAScript 6 standards and best practices.
API is the single most dominant way the world of Web communicates. This sprint gets you started with APIs and even takes you through journey of storing the data in data-stores.

### Prerequisites
Javascript is the only prerequisite to getting started with Node. The fundamentals of Javascript would take you through Node JS.
You can refer to [Sprint 3](https://github.com/greyatom-school/the-minerva-project/tree/master/FEWD/sprint_3) of our Front development program to revise the following basic and advanced Javascript concepts.

- Variables, Data types and [Type conversions](https://github.com/nehalgala7/Nodejs-concepts/blob/master/Sprint_2/Additional%20Resources/Variables_DataTypes_TypeConversions.md)
- Arrays, objects
- [Conditionals, Logical operators](https://github.com/nehalgala7/Nodejs-concepts/blob/master/Sprint_2/Additional%20Resources/Condtional_and_Logical_operators.md)
- Control flow, Loops and error handling 
- Functions, IIFE and  packages
- OOPs
- Scope
- Closures
- Hoisting
- Event Loop
- Promises
- Async-Await
