## Sprint 2 - Getting started with Advanced Javascript, Modules, APIs and Datastores

### Overview

Gets you started with basic Node.js and REST constructs and introduces you to API's and Datastores.
API is the single most dominant way the world of Web communicates. This sprint gets you started with APIs and even takes you through journey of storing the data in data-stores.

### Prerequisites
Javascript is the only prerequisite to getting started with Node. The fundamentals of Javascript would take you through Node JS.
You can refer to [Sprint 3](https://github.com/greyatom-school/the-minerva-project/tree/master/FEWD/sprint_3) of our Front development program to revise the following basic and advanced Javascript concepts and ECMAScript 6/ ES6 concepts.

- Basic and advanced constructs to learn in Javascript: 
	- Variables, Data types and [Type conversions](https://github.com/nehalgala7/Nodejs-concepts/blob/master/Sprint_2/Additional%20Resources/Variables_DataTypes_TypeConversions.md)
	- Arrays, objects
	- [Conditionals, Logical operators](https://github.com/nehalgala7/Nodejs-concepts/blob/master/Sprint_2/Additional%20Resources/Condtional_and_Logical_operators.md)
	- Control flow, Loops and error handling 
	- Functions, IIFE and  packages
	- OOPs
	- Scope
	- Closures
	- Hoisting
	- Event Loop
	- Promises
	- Async-Await

- ECMAScript 6 or ES6: 
	- Scoping with const, let
	- Arrow functions
	- Default function params
	- Rest parameter
	- Spread operator
	- Object literals
	- Loops
	- Destructuring assignments
	- Template literals
	- Classes
	- Symbol
	- Iterators
	- Promises
	- Map
	- Set
