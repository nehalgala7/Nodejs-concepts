### Overview
In this tutorial we will learn how to respond to DELETE requests using Express.

### Learning Outcome
- How to create a DELETE API using Express?

### Introduction
Now taking forward the big bazaar admin example we saw in last chapter. What if the admins wants to delete customer that was created? We need a delete API to serve this purpose. 
To handle a request where user wants to delete a record or a new  we need to create a DELETE API. 
Let us dive deep into how to create a DELETE API in Node using Express.js.
*Refer Summary section below to see the DELETE API that we have created in our project.*

### What you must do
- Understand what is the [use of DELETE method](https://reqbin.com/Article/HttpDelete)
- This [article](https://assertible.com/blog/7-http-methods-every-web-developer-should-know-and-how-to-test-them#delete) explains step by step use of each API method.
- [Learn how to create a DELETE API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEFfbK323Ok)
- Learn [how to build GET, PUT, POST, DELETE API'S in express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKd0Rpw7O48). Jump to 52:45 mins of the video if you want to only see the DELETE API part.
- Watch this video which summarises [POST, PUT and DELETE requests](https://scotch.io/courses/build-a-restful-nodejs-api/post-put-delete-requests).

### Summary
- DELETE request is used to delete a specific resource. 
- Handling DELETE request in Express is similar to what we have done with other request types so far. We have to create an instance of express and call delete method. 
```
app.delete(path, callback [, callback ...]);
```
Here is small snippet to demonstrate that.

```
app.delete("https://greayatom.com/:id", (request, response) => {
    response.rend("response");
});
```

- id of the source is required in delete request path because we want to delete a specific resource by its id.

- We need to build the following DELETE end point for our project 
DELETE: /employees/{id} : Removes a employee by ID
  
```js
app.delete("/employees/:id", (request, response) => {
    let pathParams = request.params; // request.params returns the paths params object. 
    let id = parseInt(pathParams.id); //get id path params
    let result = DatabaseOperations.deleteEmployee(id);
    if(result) {
        response.send("Employee removed successfully");
    } else {
        response.status(500).send("Error removing employee data from the database");
    }
});
```
- Example: /employees/2 - This API will delete the employee whose id is 2
