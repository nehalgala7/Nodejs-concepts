### Overview
In this tutorial we will be working with creating HTTP GET requests using Express.

### Learning Outcome
- What is a GET request? When to use it?
- How to create a GET API using Express?
- How to use query string?
- How to use path params? 

### Introduction
- Whenever any application wants any data fron the server, user makes a GET request. For example when amazon wants to display list of products under the category "books" it makes request to the server/backend to fetch this data.
This kind of request which we make to fetch data, is called a GET request. While making GET request you can send filters or more information about what you want in the form of a query param or a path variable. In the above example category="books" was one such filter.
Also, there are certain rules that we must follow while creating a GET API for example - GET request should not change the state of the server. Here the state means it may be either a database or a file or anything. We will go in depth of when to use them.

Now that we know what a GET request is. Let us see how to create our GET REST API in Express. 
- Handling GET request in Express seems so easy. You have to create instance of express and call get method. 
```
app.get(path, callback [, callback ...]);
```
Suppose that you want to create a GET API, which will take age as a query param and return the list of the customers filtered by age you pass. Here is small snippet to demonstrate that. 

```
app.get("/customers", (request, response) => {
    let {age} = queryParams; // request.params returns the paths params object. 
    //Get the data filtered by age;
    response.rend("response");
});
```

Now we you call this API - "http://example.com/customers?age=30". The above api will read the age you passed, from the query params, filter the data and send the response back to the client. 

*Refer Summary section below to see the GET API's we have created in our project.*

### What you must do
- Read [when to use a GET API](http://prideparrot.com/blog/archive/2011/10/using_http_methods_in_rest). Jump to the GET section.
- Revise what path params and query params are from the chapter - [URI and components chapter](../3.%20Introduction%20to%20APIs/3.3%20URI%20and%20its%20components.md)
- Watch this video revise the [Rest Concepts and further watch on how to write a GET API in Express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKd0Rpw7O48&t=65s). Watch only the first 30 minutes of the video.
- Read about [how to read query string and path params in express](https://stackabuse.com/get-query-strings-and-parameters-in-express-js/).
- Watch [how to write RESTful GET API's using express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKd0Rpw7O48&t=65s). Watch only first 30 mins of the video.
- Watch video which explains how to [build get requests using express](https://scotch.io/courses/build-a-restful-nodejs-api/get-requests)

### Summary
Let us start by building API's for our project -
Note: We are using local employees array in the project since we are not connected to any data.
```js
let employees = [{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "nehal",
    "email": "nehal.g@test.com",
    "phone": 1234567891,
    "address": "Mumbai 400 101",
    "designation": "developer",
    "team": "PNG"
}, {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "ankita",
    "email": "ankita.g@test.com",
    "phone": 1234567891,
    "address": "Mumbai 400 101",
    "designation": "CONSULTANT",
    "team": "CPG"
}];
```
This is going to our base data for the entire project and we will be building on top of this. But once we start using a databse we can fetch the employees from that database and perform operations on that. Also we have created a new module called Database Operations so that in furture we can change the database but the code in server.js won't be impacted.

We need 3 GET end points for our project 
1. /employee/get: This end point will fetch and return all the employees. This one is pretty straightforward

```js
app.get("/employees", (request, response) => {
    //We have seen what request and reponse are in the previous chapter.
    response.send(employees);
});
```

Output:

Futher in the above route if the user passes query string then the list will be filtered based on those filter values like name and email

```js
app.get("/employees", (request, response) => {
    // We are using local data store here sine we are not connected to any data but once we start using a databse we can fetch the employees from that database and return
    let queryParams = request.query; // request.params returns the query params object. In oour case we need to check if user has asked to filter on the basis of email or name
    let {email, name} = queryParams;
    let result = DatabaseOperations.filterByEmailAndName(email, name);
    response.send(result);
});
```

2. /employee/{id} : We will get a employee by id
Here {id} is a path parameter. 

```js
app.get("/employees/:id", (request, response) => { 
    let pathParams = request.params; // request.params returns the paths params object. 
    let id = parseInt(pathParams.id); //get id path params
    let result = DatabaseOperations.findEmployeeByID(id);
    response.send(result);
});
```

Output:
