### Overview
Though Asynchronous programming in Node has a lot of advantages. But it also a few drawbacks like, Asynchronous code consists of multiple nested callbacks which makes code hard to read and debug. These multiple nested callbacks leads to something called as a  callback hell. This section introduces to callback hell in Node and how to avoid it.

### Learning Outcome
- What is a callback hell?
- How to avoid it?

### Introduction
- Callback hell is a phenomenon that afflicts a JavaScript developer when he tries to execute multiple asynchronous operations one after the other. Some people call it to be the pyramid of doom.
Let’s have a look at an example of what we call callback hell.

```js
    // 4 times nested calls...
    fs.readFile('/test1', 'utf-8', (err1, data1) => {
        if (err1) {
            return handleError(err1); 
        } else {
            fs.readFile(data1, 'utf-8', (err2, data2) => {
                if (err2) { 
                    return handleError(err2);
                } else {
                    fs.readFile(data2, 'utf-8', (err3, data3) => {      
                        if (err3) {
                            return handleError(err3);   
                        } else {
                            fs.readFile(data3, 'utf-8', (err4, data4) => {        
                                if (err4) { 
                                    return handleError(err4);
                                } else {        
                                // ...continue after all scripts are loaded (*)    
                                }
                            });    
                        });
                    }
                }  
            });
        }
    });
    //Note- The above code is for demonstration and not a working code.
```
In the code above:
    - We load test1, then if there’s no error.
    - We load data1 then if there’s no error.
    - We load data2, then if there’s no error 
    - We load data3, then if there’s no error - do something else (*).
As you can see, this can really get out of hand. In the above example, each callback depends on the result obtained from parent callback. As calls become more nested, the code becomes deeper and increasingly more difficult to manage and hard to read, especially if we have real code instead of ... that may include more loops, conditional statements and so on. Beginners especially fall victim to this, not understanding how to avoid this "pyramid of doom".
The “pyramid” of nested calls grows to the right with every asynchronous action. Soon it spirals out of control. So this way of coding isn’t very good.

- Ways for avoiding callback hell
    - Using Promises
    - Using Async-Await
    - Using Async.js

We all know what promise and how to chain a promise. Let us see how we can solve the callback hell problem in the above example using promises -

```
fs.readFile('/test1', 'utf-8')
    .then(data1 =>
        fs.readFile(data1, 'utf-8')
    )
    .then(data2 =>
        fs.readFile(data2, 'utf-8')
    )
    .then(data3 =>
        fs.readFile(data3, 'utf-8')
    )
    .then(data4 =>
        doSomething(data4)
    )
    .catch(err =>
        handleError(err)
    );
```

The idea is that the result is passed through the chain of .then handlers.

Here the flow is:
    - The initial promise resolves and,
    - Then the .then handler is called to load data1.
    - Then the .then handler is called to load data2 …and so on.
    - Now in between if anything fails it goes to the catch function.
