### Overview
In the previous chapter, we learnt about what a database is, its importance in the backend development and various ways of storing data in Node. In this section we will explore one of those ways to store data i.e using database. 

### Learning Outcome
- How to access any database in Node?
- How to access and connect to PostgresSql in Node?

### Introduction
Node.js supports all kinds of databases whether its a relational database or NoSQL database. However, NoSQL databases like MongoDb are the best fit with Node.js. 
- In order to user any database in Node we need to install drivers, which are available in the form of external modules.
- In this section, we will learn how to install database drivers and use them in our application. Also, we will dive deep into, how to access relational database postgresSql in our node application.

### What you must do
- Read intro on [Data Access in Node.js](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/nodejs/data-access-in-nodejs)
- Watch a video on [How to Connect to PostgreSQL Database in Node](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_PlIZs8CPE)
- Once you understand how to connect to a PostgreSQL, let us see how to use it in our application in this [blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/setting-up-a-restful-api-with-node-js-and-postgresql-d96d6fc892d8/) 
- You can further explore, [how to use Postgres in Node application](https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-database-tutorial/#nodejsandpostgresql)

### Additional Resource 
- Good news, yayay now you can actually go ahead and build your own small applications like this [Recipe App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFiqctkoVJ4&list=PLillGF-RfqbaEmlPcX5e_ejaK7Y5MydkW) Using Node.js & PostgreSQL. 

### Summary
- To access the database from Node.js, you first need to install drivers for the database you want to use.
- Below is the list of few drivers available:

| Relational Databases | Driver | NPM Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MS SQL Server	| [mssql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mssql) | npm install mssql |
| Oracle	| [oracledb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oracledb)	| npm install oracledb |
| MySQL	| [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)	| npm install mysql |
| PostgreSQL | [pg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) | npm install pg |
| SQLite | [node-sqlite3](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3)	| npm install node-sqlite |

This is not the complete list of database and drivers available. Also, there are many drivers available for each database. You can choose a driver based on your requirement.

Since we are going to use postgresSql. Let us begin by installing drive for the same using the command.
```
    npm install pg
```

- In order to use the database in your application we need to connect to the data and maintain the connection throughout the lifecycle.

- In this chapter we will this how to connect to postgresSql. This is just to understand how to connect to a database. In our Nodejs program we will learn about MongoDB and CRUD operations in MongoDB in depth in the upcoming sprints.

2. Connecting to PostgresSql
- To connect to a database you need client object. The client needs following config properties: 
    - host: The host that the database is operating on should have been provided by your hosting provider.  Typically this would be configured as localhost, assuming your web server and database server are on the same host. It will be "localhost" in our case.
    - port: The port on which it is running. The default PostgreSQL port is 5432.
    - user: The user name of the database
    - database: Name of the database to connect to
    - password of teh database

- Add the snippet below to connect to a database. 
```
const client = new Client({
  user: 'dbuser',
  host: 'database.server.com',
  database: 'mydb',
  password: 'secretpassword',
  port: 5432 
});
```
Note: These are example values. Use the values you have added while configuring the database.

Once we create the instance of the client we need to use client.connect to connect to the database. 

```
client.connect()
    .then(() > {
        console.log("connected successfully"); // this is executed if the connection is succesfull
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.log("error connecting to database", error); // this block is executed when there is some error connecting to the database.
    });
```
client.connect() return a promise. so we can execute the then once the promise is resolved.
