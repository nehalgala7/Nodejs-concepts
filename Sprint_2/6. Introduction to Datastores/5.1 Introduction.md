### Overview
Have you ever wondered where amazon/flipkart stores its customer order related details? or for that matter where does a company store its employee related details. Everyone uses something called as a database. There are different types of databases available to store different type of data. Understanding which database type to use or how to use it is key to building any backend application end to end. So Let us begin with it.

### Learning Outcome
- What is a datastore?
- Types of datastore or databases?

### Introduction
Now that we have learnt about how to create a module and how to create API's. Next step to build any backend application is to learn how to connect your application to databases so that you can store user/application data. In this concept you will learn the basics of using databases with Node.js.

### What you must do
- Before starting with how to use databases in Node. It is important to know 
    - [Fundamentals of database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR4QIeZaPeM)
    - [Types of databases](https://www.alooma.com/blog/types-of-modern-databases).
- Understand [ways in which you can store data in Node application](https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-database-tutorial/).
- Since Postgresql and Mongo are among the most used one's. Lets Get acquainted with on of the them. [what is postgresSQL?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VO7YjQeG6Y)
- Download and install PostgresSql on your machine
    - [Official website](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)
    -  There are a lot of youtube videos available to help you out with how to install postgreSql deping on your operation system
- Download and install pgAdmin 4
    - [Official website](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)
- Watch a video on [Intro To PostgreSQL Databases With PgAdmin For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd2ej-QKrWY)

#### Additional Resources
- Watch a video - [this video will help beginners understand the basics of database management systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR0jg0eQsZA)
- If you want to dive deep into postgresSql. This is the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw--VYLpxG4) for you. This will be useful irrespective of the backend language you learn in the future.


#### Summary of datastore in Node
In Node there are various ways of storing the data. 
1. Storing data in global object
```
    const employees = []

    app.post('/employees', function (req, res) {
        // get employee data from the request body
        const employee = req.body;
        employees.push({
            name: employee.name,
            age: employee.age,
            email: employee.email
        });
        res.send('Employee successfully added');
    })
```

If you store the data in global variable like this it will reside in the memory for the lifetime of your application. The only caveat is if you restart the application the data will be lost since all the variable will be re-initialised.

2. Storing data in a file
The next thing that we can do is store data in a file. This will solve the problem with stroing the data in global variable
```
    const fs = require('fs')

    app.post('/employees', function (req, res) {
        const employee = req.body;
        fs.appendFile('employees.txt', JSON.stringify({
            name: employee.name,
            age: employee.age,
            email: employee.email
        }), (err) => {
            if (err) {
                console.log('Error saving employee!');
            } else {
                res.send('Employee successfully added');;
            }
        })
    });
```

This way we wonâ€™t lose user data, not even after a server reset.
However storing user data this way still has a couple of problems:
    - Appending is okay, but think about updating or deleting.
    - If we're working with files, there is no easy way to access them in parallel (system-wide locks will prevent you from writing).
    - Scaling our application will be an issue

This is where real databases come into picture. This [blog](What is Database? What is SQL?) walks you through what is a database and why is it important.
