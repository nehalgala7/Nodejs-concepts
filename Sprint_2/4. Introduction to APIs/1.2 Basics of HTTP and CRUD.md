### Overview
Tim had written the three fundamental technologies that remain the foundation of today’s web. HTTP is one of them. This section introduces you to what HTTP is, HTTP architecture and CRUD operations using http.

### Learning Outcome
- What is HTTP?
- HTTP architecture.
- How HTTP works

### Introduction
#### HTTP
- HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- It is an application protoccol for transferring Resources across the internet
- It is a set of rules for how to transfer data on the web. 
- You've seen http:// in web addresses, of course. Now you’re going to use the same protocol to transfer data between your app and the server.
- HTTP specification specifies how clients' request data will be constructed and sent to the server, and how the servers respond to these requests.


#### HTTP architecture
- The following diagram shows a very basic architecture of a web application and depicts where HTTP sits:

- The HTTP protocol is a request/response protocol based on the client/server based architecture where web browsers and search engines, etc. act like HTTP clients, and the Web server acts as a server.

- Client
The HTTP client sends a request to the server in the form of a request method, URI, and protocol version, client information, and request data over a TCP/IP connection.

- Server
The HTTP server responds with a response to the client. The response has any parts to it like the status code, nody etc.

#### How HTTP works

- HTTP sessions are opened by an HTTP Client i.e user browser and a connection Request Message is sent to an HTTP Server (i.e. the Web Server). The Request Message is also known as the ‘Client Request’ and consists of the following lines:
    - Request line
    - Headers
    - An empty line
    - An optional message body

Once the response has been delivered the Web Server closes the connection. This type of connection is known as Stateless in that it exists only for the duration of the data exchange.

Depending on the availability or otherwise of the Resource HTTP provides an appropriate status code (also referred to as the ‘Server Response’) determined by the protocol. These are as [follows](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/http/http_status_codes.htm)
