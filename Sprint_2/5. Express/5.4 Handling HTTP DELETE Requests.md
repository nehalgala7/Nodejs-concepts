### Overview
In this tutorial we will learn how to respond to DELETE requests using Express.

### Learning Outcome
- How to create a DELETE API using Express?

### Introduction
- DELETE request is used to delete a specific resource. 
- Handling DELETE request in Express is similar to what we have done with other request types so far. We have to create an instance of express and call delete method. 
```
app.delete(path, callback [, callback ...]);
```
Here is small snippet to demonstrate that.

```
app.delete("https://greayatom.com/:id", (request, response) => {
    response.rend("response");
});
```

- id of the source is required in delete request path because we want to delete a specific resource by its id.

- We need to build the following DELETE end point for our project 
DELETE: /employees/{id} : Removes a employee by ID
  
```js
app.delete("/employees/:id", (request, response) => {
    let pathParams = request.params; // request.params returns the paths params object. 
    let id = parseInt(pathParams.id); //get id path params
    let result = DatabaseOperations.deleteEmployee(id);
    if(result) {
        response.send("Employee removed successfully");
    } else {
        response.status(500).send("Error removing employee data from the database");
    }
});
```
- Example: /employees/2 - This API will delete the employee whose id is 2
