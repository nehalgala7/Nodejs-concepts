### Overview
In this tutorial we will be working with creating HTTP GET requests using Express.
In [URI and components chapter](../4.%20Introduction%20to%20APIs/4.3%20URI%20and%20its%20components.md) we have learnt about path params and query params. In this section we learn how to use them with express routes.

### Learning Outcome
- How to create a GET API using Express?
- How to use query string?
- How to use path params? 

### Introduction
- GET are suppose to use to retrieve data only. 
- Handling GET request in Express seems so easy. You have to create instance of express and call get method. 
```
app.get(path, callback [, callback ...]);
```
Here is small snippet to demonstrate that.

```
app.get("https://stackabuse.com/?page=2&limit=3", (request, response) => {
    response.rend("response");
});
```

Let us start by building API's for our project -
Note: We are using local employees array in the project since we are not connected to any data.
```js
let employees = [{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "nehal",
    "email": "nehal.g@test.com",
    "phone": 1234567891,
    "address": "Mumbai 400 101",
    "designation": "developer",
    "team": "PNG"
}, {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "ankita",
    "email": "ankita.g@test.com",
    "phone": 1234567891,
    "address": "Mumbai 400 101",
    "designation": "CONSULTANT",
    "team": "CPG"
}];
```
This is going to our base data for the entire project and we will be building on top of this. But once we start using a databse we can fetch the employees from that database and perform operations on that. Also we have created a new module called Database Operations so that in furture we can change the database but the code in server.js won't be impacted.

We need 3 GET end points for our project 
1. /employee/get: This end point will fetch and return all the employees. This one is pretty straightforward

```js
app.get("/employees", (request, response) => {
    //We have seen what request and reponse are in the previous chapter.
    response.send(employees);
});
```

Output:

Futher in the above route if the user passes query string then the list will be filtered based on those filter values like name and email

```js
app.get("/employees", (request, response) => {
    // We are using local data store here sine we are not connected to any data but once we start using a databse we can fetch the employees from that database and return
    let queryParams = request.query; // request.params returns the query params object. In oour case we need to check if user has asked to filter on the basis of email or name
    let {email, name} = queryParams;
    let result = DatabaseOperations.filterByEmailAndName(email, name);
    response.send(result);
});
```

2. /employee/{id} : We will get a employee by id
Here {id} is a path parameter. 

```js
app.get("/employees/:id", (request, response) => { 
    let pathParams = request.params; // request.params returns the paths params object. 
    let id = parseInt(pathParams.id); //get id path params
    let result = DatabaseOperations.findEmployeeByID(id);
    response.send(result);
});
```

Output:
