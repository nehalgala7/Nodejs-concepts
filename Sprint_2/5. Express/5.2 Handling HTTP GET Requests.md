### Overview
In this tutorial we will be working with creating HTTP get requests using Express.
In [URI and components chapter](../4.%20Introduction%20to%20APIs/4.3%20URI%20and%20its%20components.md) we have learnt about path params and query params. In this section we learn how to use them with express routes.

This concept covers all the pivotal topics of REST API's using express and Node. To better onboard the topics, we will also be building a simple 'Employee Manageent App' throughout the concept. Read about the project details [here](../7.%20project/project.md)


### Learning Outcome
- How to create a GET API using Express?
- How to user path params and query string? 

### Introduction
- GET are suppose to use to retrieve data only. 
- Handling GET request in Express seems so easy. You have to create instance of express and call get method. 
```
app.get(path, callback [, callback ...]);
```
Here is small snippet to demonstrate that.

```
app.get("https://stackabuse.com/?page=2&limit=3", (request, response) => {
    response.rend("response");
});
```

Let us start by building API's for our project -
Note: We are using local employees array in the project since we are not connected to any data.

```js
let employees = [{
    "name": "nehal",
    "email": "nehal.g@test.com",
    "phone": 1234567891,
    "address": "Mumbai 400 101",
    "designation": "developer",
    "team": "PNG"
}];
```
This is going to our base data for the entire project and we will be building on top of this. But once we start using a databse we can fetch the employees from that database and perform operations on that.

We need 3 GET end points for our project 
1. /employee/get: This end point will fetch and return all the employees. This one is pretty straightforward

```js
    app.get("/employees/get", (request, response) => {
    //We have seen what request and reponse are in the previous chapter.
    response.send(employees);
});
```

Output:

2. /employee/get/{id} : We will get a employee by id
Here {id} is a path parameter.
