### Overview
While building any large scale applications, we talk about resuability, modularity etc. Every language has a different way to do it. In Node js, it is modules that help us achieve all this. Let us deep dive into the heart of Node js i.e Modules.

### Learning Outcome
- What are Node.js modules?
- What are Built-in Modules?
- How to use External Modules?
- How to create a module and use them in your project?
- How are modules resolved in Node.js?

### Introduction
- To explain in simple terms, modules are self-contained units of functionality that can be shared and reused across projects. 
- Let us understand the importance of modules in any language: They make our lives as developers easier, as we can use them to augment our applications with functionality that we haven’t had to write ourselves. They also allow us to organize and decouple our code, leading to applications that are easier to understand, debug and maintain. 

Let us begin with understanding how to work with node js modules:
- Modules are the most fundamental concept of Node.js projects. This what allows us to load functionalities in our apps and do interesting things. For example, if you want to connect to a database or read or write from a file you will need to use node module system. All these are very basic functionalities that are needed build any backend applications.
- In short, Node.js Module is a library of functions that could be used in a Node.js file.

### What you must do
- To understand the use of modules and know its importance, understand the concept of [modular design in programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_XyeWg_3EE&t=317s) and its importance in software architecture [here](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/software-processes/software-design-modularity-xH6BK).
- Read about what are [modules and its types in Node](https://www.tutorialkart.com/nodejs/nodejs-modules/)
- Listen to [What is a module in Node](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Amxzvq5LY8&list=PLTjRvDozrdlydy3uUBWZlLUTNpJSGGCEm&index=8&t=0s)
We go in depth about modules in our upcoming sections.


### Summary
- In simple terms, a Node module is basically a Javascript file. So lets say if you are creating a file calculator.js, you are basically creating a node.js module. 

### There are Types of Module

1. Core module: When you install node, it comes with many built-in modules. Few of them are - https, os, fs, net, etc.
These you don’t have to install it, you can import them and use them in your programs. 

2. Third-party module or external modules: Modules that you install from any package manager. We use these modules to accomplish or simplify any existing task. For example, to simplify our web API development we use express, or to deal with date and time we use moment.

3. Local module: These are the modules that we create for our own use. These modules basically consist of core business logic of our code.

We will learn more about how to import each of these types and how to use them in the next chapters.
