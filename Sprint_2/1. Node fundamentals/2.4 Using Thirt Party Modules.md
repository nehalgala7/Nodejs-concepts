### Overview
In this chapter we will learn how to use the modules built and open sourced by other developers across the world in our application so that we do not have to reinvent the wheel for every new application.

### Learning Outcome
- How to install third party modules?
- How to use them in our application?

### Introduction
- The build-in/core modules that comes in node.js provide us with lot of basic problem functionalities, without having us to write these modules on our own.
- But the best part about node.js is the huge ecosystem of open source modules provided by the Node.js community. 
These modules can be integrated into our codebase, too. For example rather than wirting the email validation code all over again we can use the code that some other developer has written or a code that sends an email, there are lot of such common functionalities that every application need. Rather than writting the code from scratch we can use the cod ethat other developers have already written and focus and use our time on building the unqiue functionality that our applications has to offer.
- Lets use see how to use the modules that are built by other developers or in other words the npm modules that are available.
- Now because they are not built-in and don’t ship directly with each installation of Node.js, we need first install them in our application before we could import and use them. Let us see how to do that.

### What you must do
- Jump to the [Third party module](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/nodejs-modules/) section in this blog and understand how to use them.
- Watch a video on External Modules Node.js
    - [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHnHSO8o0Fk).
    - [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgiGF-c44n8).

#### Additional Resources
- Read about [Downloading and installing npm packages locally](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-packages-locally) in node.
- [A Beginner’s Guide to npm — the Node Package Manager](https://www.sitepoint.com/beginners-guide-node-package-manager/).

#### Summary
#### Installing external modules/ third party modules locally
To install third party or external module we need to follow 2 steps
1. Initialize npm in our project 
    - The NPM program is installed on your computer when you install Node.js (which we have already done in sprint 1).
2. Download and Install the npm package we want to use.
    - Go to www.npmjs.com and find the package you want to use.
    - www.npmjs.com hosts thousands of free packages to download and use.
    - Downloading a package is very easy. 
    - Go to the command line interface and then go inside your project folder and tell NPM to download the package you want using the command: npm install "package name"
    - For example if you want to use email-validator module. Download [email-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/email-validator) by running - npm install email-validator.

#### Using the downloaded and installed package in your application
Include the "email-validator" package the same way you included a core module in the last chapter.

```
    var validator = require("email-validator");
    validator.validate("test@email.com"); // true
```
