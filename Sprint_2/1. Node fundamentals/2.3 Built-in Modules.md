### Overview
Now we that we know the know the importance of modules. Let us dive deep into of the 3 types of modules i.e core modules or built-in modules in Node. 

### Learning Outcome
- What are core or built-in modules in node?
- How to use them in our application?


### Introduction
Modules help us take advantage of all the cool features that Node has to provide. There are some modules that are globally available. Like there is fs module in node, which help us read, write or create a file, that is globally available, we do not have to do anything specical to use them. These are called core modules/ built-in modules in node. Others module types require us to first load them and then use them.

In this section we will see how to use a core module in Node.

### What you must do
- Read about what are [core modules](https://riptutorial.com/node-js/example/30139/core-modules)
- Before moving on to how to create your own module or how to external modoule or to use any type of a module, it it important to understand the concept of [Requiring a module in Node](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44b6CDDnDPg&list=PLTjRvDozrdlydy3uUBWZlLUTNpJSGGCEm&index=9) in Node.
- Futher deep dive into core modules with examples in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cnJcXwwQRA) and [blog](https://www.fullstacktutorials.com/tutorials/nodejs/nodejs-core-modules.html)
- [Explore one of the core module in Node i.e fs](), to understand how to use them in your application

### Additional Resources
- Read about [core modules](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/nodejs/nodejs-modules) in node.

### Summary
-   Node.js has a set of built-in modules which you can use without any further installation.
-   The core modules include bare minimum functionalities of Node.js. These core modules are compiled into its binary distribution and load automatically when Node.js process starts. However, you need to import the core module first in order to use it in your application.
-   They are referred by the module name, not the path.

### List of important core modules in Node.js
- [fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html): Allows you to manipulate (create/read/write) files and directories.
- [path](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html): utilities to work with files and directories paths.
- [http](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html): create HTTP servers and clients for web development.
- [url](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html): utilities for parsing URLs and extracting elements from it.


### How to use core modules.
In order to use core modules, we need to import them into out application. 
To do this, we need to require the module using the "require" keyword and assign the result to a variable. We saw in our global objects section that require is a globally available module hence we can use it directly in any module.

For example we want to use "http" module mentioned above. we need to write the below require statement to import the module, before using the http module and store it in a variable.

```
    var http = require(‘http’);
```
   
Once you have included a module by assigning it to a variable, the functions in the module could be accessed through the variable.

In the above module section, an example for including http module is provided. Now we shall use a function of http module called createServer() to demonstrate on how to use a function of a module.

``` 
    var http = require('http');
    
    http.createServer(function (req, res) {
        res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
        res.write('Node.js module says Hello!');
        res.end();
    }).listen(8080);
 
```

We learn more about how require works in depth in our last chapter of this section.
